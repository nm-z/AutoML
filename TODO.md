# AutoML Project TODO

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR CONTRIBUTORS
**As of latest update**: All PRs must be based on this new goal-oriented structure. PRs #124-#127 were closed because they reverted this structure. Please ensure your PRs:
1. Start from the current main branch
2. Preserve this goal-oriented TODO format
3. Include actual dataset training results when relevant
4. Align with Goals 1 or 2 below

## 🎯 Primary Goals

### Goal 1: Successfully Train All Engines on Dataset 2 (D2)
**Objective**: Get AutoGluon, Auto-Sklearn, and TPOT all running successfully on `DataSets/2/D2-Predictors.csv` and `DataSets/2/D2-Targets.csv`

**Current Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL - LIBRARIES NOT INSTALLED
- AutoGluon: ❌ Module not found ('autogluon')
- Auto-Sklearn: ❌ Module not found ('autosklearn') 
- TPOT: ❌ Module not found ('tpot')
- **All engines falling back to LinearRegression with R² = -1.3353**

**Sub-tasks**:
- [ ] **URGENT**: Fix library installation in current environment (env-tpa)
- [ ] **URGENT**: Verify pyenv environments are properly activated
- [ ] **URGENT**: Install missing AutoML libraries (autogluon, tpot, auto-sklearn)
- [ ] **URGENT**: Test basic import functionality for all three engines
- [ ] Debug TPOT parameter validation errors (after installation)
- [ ] Verify all three engines can complete training on D2
- [ ] Document training results and performance metrics

### Goal 2: Achieve R² > 0.95 on Dataset 2
**Objective**: Optimize hyperparameters and feature engineering to achieve high performance

**Current Status**: 🔴 BLOCKED (requires Goal 1 completion)
- Best current result: R²=0.8383 (AutoGluon - from previous runs)
- Current result: R²=-1.3353 (LinearRegression fallback)
- Target: R² > 0.95

**Sub-tasks**:
- [ ] Baseline all engines on D2 (requires Goal 1 completion)
- [x] Implement hyperparameter tuning strategies (RandomizedSearchCV utility)
- [ ] Add feature engineering pipeline
- [x] Experiment with ensemble methods (weighted ensemble script)
- [ ] Document optimization strategies and results

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Setup Tasks

### Environment Management
- [x] Setup script creates `automl-py310` and `automl-py311` pyenv environments automatically
- [x] Fixed `run_all.sh` pyenv initialization for non-interactive shells
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix library installation in pyenv environments
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify environment activation scripts work properly
- [ ] Implement Python 3.10 graceful fallback when unavailable
- [ ] Create offline wheel installation support for restricted networks

### Testing & Validation
- [x] Added `--tree` flag to orchestrator for artifact directory display
- [x] Smoke test passes for basic orchestrator functionality (but with LinearRegression fallback)
- [x] Added test_imports.py script for library verification
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix smoke test to use actual AutoML libraries instead of fallbacks
- [ ] Improve smoke test documentation and error handling
- [ ] Verify `run_all.sh` works with all dataset combinations
- [ ] Add integration tests for all three engines

### Code Quality & Maintenance
- [x] Resolved scikit-learn version conflicts between engines
- [x] Fixed orchestrator duration calculation AttributeError
- [x] Fixed Makefile indentation issues
- [x] Enhanced console logging with rich.tree progress display
- [x] Added TPOT parameter validation improvements
- [ ] **ACTIVE**: Address datetime.utcnow() deprecation warning

## 📊 Dataset Training Tasks

### Dataset 1 (D1) - Reference Implementation
- [x] All engines successfully train on D1 (historically)
- ❌ **CURRENT**: All engines failing due to missing libraries
- [x] Baseline performance metrics established (historically)
- [x] Used as smoke test dataset in `run_all.sh`

### Dataset 2 (D2) - Primary Focus
- [x] Create reproducible training script for D2 (`run_d2.sh`)
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Complete successful training run with all engines (libraries missing)
- [ ] Document training results and failure modes
- [ ] Compare performance across engines
- [ ] Identify optimization opportunities
- [ ] Provide offline dependency install instructions to unblock Dataset 2 training

### Dataset 3 (D3) - Future Work
- [ ] Initial training runs with all engines
- [ ] Performance baseline establishment
- [ ] Comparison with D1 and D2 results
