# TODO

## Completed Tasks

- Git LFS setup completed, including tracking of `.pkl`, `.json`, `DataSets/`, and `05_outputs/` directories. Git history has been cleaned to properly track large files.
- `orchestrator.py` `AttributeError` for duration calculation fixed.
- Smoke test for `orchestrator.py` passed successfully. All engines (AutoGluon, Auto-Sklearn, TPOT) executed, data loaded, split, and artifacts saved.

## Remaining Action Items

- Update environment setup to ensure required Python packages (e.g., pandas) are installed before running the orchestrator.
- Modify `setup.sh` to either create `env-as` or skip the activation test if it is not needed.
- Enhance console logs using `rich.tree` so run progress is shown as a clear tree.
- Add a `--tree` flag to `orchestrator.py` to optionally print artifact directories in tree form.
- Create tests verifying tree-formatted output appears when the flag is used.
